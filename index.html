    <h1>Welcome to my 'TimeStamp MS' page</h1>

            
<p>This is a microservice which returns the date in natural language form as well as the corresponding unix timestamp form.</p>

<h3>
Example usage:</h3>

<p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Pass in a unix timestamp, and get back the date in both formats:
        <pre>
        e.g:
        https://mysterious-fortress-88705.herokuapp.com/1450539600000
        {"unix":1450539600000,"natural":"December 19, 2015"}
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Pass in a human readable date, and get back the date in both formats
        (Note that any spaces will get replaced by %20 by the browser automatically):
        If date is given as numbers separated by dashes, it will be interpreted as MM-DD-YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD by default
        If month name is spelled out, either a three character month name or full name is acceptable.
        <pre>
        e.g:
        https://mysterious-fortress-88705.herokuapp.com/1982%20November%205
        {"unix":405302400000,"natural":"November 5, 1982"}
        
        https://mysterious-fortress-88705.herokuapp.com/Dec%2020,2089
        {"unix":3785875200000,"natural":"December 20, 2089"}
        
        https://mysterious-fortress-88705.herokuapp.com/12-31-1991
        {"unix":694137600000,"natural":"December 31, 1991"}
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Any invalid input (non-date), or an unrecognized date format will cause null to be returned.
        <pre>
        e.g:
        https://mysterious-fortress-88705.herokuapp.com/Once%20upon%20a%20time
        {"unix":null,"natural":null}
        </pre>
    </li>
</ol>

Following user stories are covered in this microservice: 
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
User Story 1: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).        
    </li>
    <li>
User Story 2: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.        
    </li>
    <li>
User Story 3: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.        
    </li>
</ul>
